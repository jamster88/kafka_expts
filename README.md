# Jamsters Kafka Experiments

These are some experiments for me to get hands-on knowledge of working with Kafka using the various languages I know.  So Far I've done:
* C - writer ONLY

I plan to also do:
* C - reader TOO
* C++ - writer AND reader
* Java - writer AND reader
* Python - writer AND reader
* Scala - writer AND reader


I also plan to extend the code I write to do the additional functions:
* Send a custom message via command-line parameters
* Monitor a text/log file and send updates/deltas
* Monitor a directory of text/log files and send updates/deltas
* Leverage TLS to communicate with the Kafka instance
